<p>This survey collects research regarding visual analysis of computing
systems, with an emphasis understanding performance behavior. It was
  originally collected for a <a
    href="data/papers_pdf/Isaacs2014STAR.pdf">EuroVis 2014 State of the Art
    Report</a>, but is continually updated. As the focus is performance, this
  collection consciously omits research in software visualization for other
  purposes such as the evolution of software, programming environments, visual
  programming, and software organization unless there is some overlap with
  performance. Visualization for debugging and general program comprehension
  tend to overlap, so those works are included as appropriate.

Please contact me if you have comments, suggestions, submissions, or are interested in collaborating on research in this area.
