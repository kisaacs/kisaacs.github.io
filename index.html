<h3>About</h3>

<p>I am an associate professor at the University of Utah in the School of Computing and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/">SCI Institute</a>. I was previously an
assistant professor at the University of Arizona and a member of the <a
href="https://hdc.cs.arizona.edu">Humans, Data, and Computers Lab</a> (HDC).
    My interests are at the intersection of data visualization and computing
systems. I develop new methods of representing complex computing processes for
exploration and analysis of their behavior, with applications to high
performance computing, distributed computing, data science, program analysis,
    and optimization. I maintain a survey of such visualizations <a
href="STAR">here</a>. I was awarded an NSF CAREER grant (<a
    href="http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kisaacs/projects/gvss/">NSF
    1844573</a>) in 2019 and a DOE Early Career Research Program grant in
    2021.</p>

<h4>Improving Node-Link Diagrams for Graph Visualizations in Computing Systems </h4>
 <div class="project-images">
 <a href="images/cfgconf.png"><img src="images/cfgconf-thumbnail.png" height=210 
    alt="Image of a graph drawing produced by CFGConf. Loops are drawn with a canonical layout and highlighted with an orange background.

 </div>

 <div class="project-text">

<p>Graphs are prevalent in computing systems. Control flow graphs describe
paths through programs. Call graphs describe relations among functions. Task
graphs describe ordering of work units. Dependency graphs describe
relationships among libraries. Thus, people working in computing often have
need to examine these graphs. However, general graph drawing approaches often
cannot scale to the needs of these workers or when they do, provide a drawing
that is difficult to interpret. We are developing approaches that identify and
incorporate drawing conventions and layout algorithms to address these
challenges. </p>

 <div class="project-text">

<p>Performance analysis is often a highly exploratory endeavor. Visualization
can help make sense of the vast quantities of data that can be collected from
advanced parallel applications. However, both visual encodings and rendering
latency are often hampered by the scale of data to be shown. The problem is
exacerbated when multiple datasets are to be analyzed in tandem. Through work
supported by the Department of Energy (DOE Early Career Research Award) and
the Defense Technical Information Center, we are addressing these challenges
to bring scalable, interactive, and interoperable visualizations for
performance analysis.</p>

<p>A key part in any visualization project is understanding the data to be
visualized. There are several factors regarding data, including the format,
    ranges, meaning, and form. We seek to understand how people conceptuatlize
their data and how we, as visualization designers and researchers, can improve
our processes of data and workflow discovery. We conducted a study to delve
deeper into questions about how people think and cast their data. We identify
and define <i>latent data abstractions—data abstractions</i> which are useful
and meaningful, but not yet fully gestated. We report on our observations and
produce guidance for further data discovery.</p>

Infographics are a widely-viewed visualization medium, used to communicate and
engage the general public with data on a wide breadth of subjects. To better
understand the space of infographics, we derive a classification using the
groupings of people from that general public on a corpus of infographics. We
found people grouped them by their primary data encoding over other criteria
such as aesthetics and complexity and that there was a prevalence in
    area-as-quantity and proprotion-as-quantity, not typically associated with
a common chart type.</p>

<h4>Control Flow Graphs and Dynamic Traces, with Science Up To Par (s2par): Language Agnostic Optimization of Scientific Data Analysis Codes</h4>

 <div class="project-text">

<p> Parallelizing scientific and data analysis applications can require
significant engineering effort. For in-development applications and frequently
altered data analysis scripts especially, the time commitment is a significant
barrier to the gains of parallelization. Science Up To Par applies dynamic
binary analysis and specialization to automatically parallelize scientific
applications in a language-independent manner. This project is in collaboration
with <a href="http://cgi.cs.arizona.edu/~mstrout/">Michelle Strout</a> and <a

these efforts, as part of the NSF-funded <a

<h4>Ravel - Parallel Execution Trace Visualization</h4>
 <div class="project-images">
 <a href="images/mgS16ravel.png"><img src="images/mgS16ravel-thumbnail.png"
    alt="Screenshot from the Ravel trace visualization software. The top of the image shows a logical time Gantt chart, revealing communication patterns in the trace. The colors of the events show how late each one was with respect to its peers. The bottom shows a traditional Gantt chart, also colored by lateness."></a>
 </div>

 <div class="project-text">
<p>
Traces are records of actions occurring during a program's execution, such as
function calls and communication. They are a powerful tool in performance
analysis as they can contain the detailed data necessary to reconstruct
exactly what occurred. However, understanding traces is
difficult due to the huge number of actions and relationships among all
processes. As such, timeline visualizations are frequently employed to explore the data.
Unfortunately, timelines become cluttered and difficult to interpret for even moderate numbers of
processes.
</p>

<p>Ravel focuses on increasing the scalability and utility of trace visualizations
via a structure-centric approach which approximates the developers' intended
organization of trace events. Visualizing this logical structure untangles
communication patterns, allows aggregation in process space, and provides users
with much needed context.  Analyses using Ravel have led to the discovery and
understanding of performance issues in several massively parallel applications.

 <div class="project-text">
 <p>
Numerous factors, such as the placement of specific tasks in the hardware,
their timing data, and functions of multiple tasks, affect the performance of
parallel applications. Boxfish was developed to support visualizing these
relationships. Boxfish manages complex filtering of data and linking of
visualizations, even when these relationships are not direct or bijective.
Several network visualization modules have been developed for Boxfish,
including multiple views of 3D torus/mesh networks and a 5D torus/mesh.
Analysis using these visualizations in Boxfish has aided in understanding the
interactions of task assignment and the underlying system network for both
individual applications and the interactions of several applications on a
shared system.

 <div class="project-text">
 <p>
Traditional statistical plots and graphics for performance analysis may prove
ineffective because they do not show data in the most meaningful context. For
one library, this meant mapping performance data to its communication overlay.
The communication graph grows as the application uses increasing numbers of
parallel processes. This requires a visualization that aggregates intelligently
to scale with that parallism while still depicting behaviors of interest.
